          we publish data and research to bring attention to large, yet slow transformative processes (e.g. historical reductions in child mortality) that are rarely covered by the media.

          Our mission is to make data about the world available and understandable to give everyone the research to develop a worldview that goes beyond anecdotes and single events.

            <h4 class="mission-item-title">Academic research is disconnected from public discourse</h4>
          Research is often hidden behind paywalls, buried in spreadsheets, and written for a specialist audience only. We explain and disseminate important findings that would otherwise be inaccessible to a general audience.

           we show that in many ways living conditions around the world are getting better; communicating this enables people to pursue more of what works and to be motivated to engage with the challenges that we face.

          The price of textbooks is often prohibitively high and especially in developing countries educators lack relevant material. We prepare our work to be used as teaching material by everyone without restriction.

      <h2>Projects</h2>

      <h3><a href="https://www.ourworldindata.org/">Our World in Data</a></h3>
      <p>Our World in Data is a website that shows how global living conditions and the earth’s environment are changing. The publication is a collaborative effort between the researchers of the <a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/research/programmes/global-development">Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development</a> at the <em>University of Oxford</em>, who are the scientific editors of the website content; and the non-profit organization <em>Global Change Data Lab</em>, who publishes and maintains the website.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://sdg-tracker.org/">Sustainable Development Goals Tracker</a></h3>
      <p>Our SDG Tracker presents data across all available indicators from the Our World in Data database, using official statistics from the UN and other international organizations. It is the first publication that tracks global progress towards the SDGs.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/teaching">Global Change Teaching Hub</a></h3>
      <p>On the Global Change Teaching Hub professors and students find notes, presentation slides, and charts for teaching and learning about global development.</p>

      <h3>Other projects</h3>
      <p>We have a number of smaller projects such as <a href="https://africaindata.org/">Africa in Data</a>, a tool to standardize country names in international statistics, and regularly partner with media organizations to provide data and research on global change.</p>
