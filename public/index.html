      <p>Global Change Data Lab is a nonprofit organization and a registered charity in the education sector (Company
        Number 11725483 and Charity Number 1186433, Charity Commission for England and Wales).</p>
      <p>Our purpose is to advance education in how global living conditions and the earth’s environment are changing,
        through the production and maintenance of public online resources. Our flagship project, the web publication
        ​<em> Our World in Data</em>​ (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">ourworldindata.org</a>), is focused on increasing the use of data and evidence to make progress
        against the world’s largest problems.</p>
      <h2>Our Work</h2>
      <p>We believe that a key reason why societies fail to achieve progress is that we do not make enough use of
        existing research and data: important knowledge is often stored in inaccessible databases, locked away behind
        paywalls and buried under jargon in academic papers.</p>
      <p>Our work is therefore focused on producing free and open educational resources that help make the knowledge on
        the big problems accessible and understandable.</p>
